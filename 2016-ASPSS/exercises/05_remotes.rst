- Create a github project.
- Add the url of the project as a remote called ``my_repository``.
- Push your changes to github:
  ``git push my_repository master``
- Check on github that you have indeed pushed your changes.
- Fetch the changes from the remote ``origin``.
- Merge the changes from ``origin/master`` to your local master branch (there
  may be a conflict - if so, resolve it).
- Push the new changes to your remote called ``my_repository``.
