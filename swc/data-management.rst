A Quick Guide to Organizing Computational (Biology) Projects
================================================================================

----

Or how to organize files, directories and document progress.

----

Poor organizational choices lead to significantly slower research progress

Make your research reproducable

----

Who's one First?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

  "A Graduate Student comes into a Professor's office and says, "That idea you
  told me to try - it doesn't work!". [..] Unfortunately, the Student's
  descriptions of the problems he is dacing don't give the Professor much
  insight on what's going on"

----

A year is time long in this business
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

  "When he went back to the old software library [..], he couldn't remember
  how the software worked - invocation of sequences, data structures, etc. in
  the end, he abandonned the project, saying he just didn't have time to get
  into it anymore.

A la recherche des param√®tres perdues
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

  "Well, actually, the reason we didn't give many details in the paper is that
  we forgot which parameters gave the nice paper you see in the published
  article; when we tried to reconstruct that figure using parameters that we
  thought had been used, we only got ugly looking results. So we knew there
  had been some parameter settings which worked well, and perhaps on day we
  would stumble on them again; but we thought it best to leave things vague"

(note: this story is actually a composite of two separate true incidents)

Plan
----

- Principles
- File and directory  organization
- The lab notebook
- Carrying out a Single Experiment
- Handling and preventing errors
- Command line vs script vs program

----

Principles
--------------------------------------------------

----

  "Someone unfamiliar with your project should be able to look at your
  computer files and understand in detail what you did and why."

----

  "Everything you do, you will have to do other and other again"

----

File and directory  organization
---------------------------------

----

images

----

The lab notebook
--------------------------------------------------

----


- entries should be dated
- verbose, links or embedded images, tables
- results of all the experiments performed

----

Carrying out a Single Experiment
--------------------------------------------------

--------

- record everything you do
- in practice, create a README

----

6 steps
---------

- Record every operation you perform
- Comment generously
- Avoid editing intermediate files by hand
- Store all files and directory names in the script
- Use relative pathnames to access files within the same project
- Make the script restartable

----

Handling and preventing errors
--------------------------------------------------

----

You **will** introduce errors into your code

----

3 suggestions for error handling
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

- Write robust code to detect errors
- When an error occurs abort
- Whenever possible, create an output file using a temporary name, and rename
  the file when the script is complete

----

Command line vs script vs program
--------------------------------------------------

----

xkcd

----

4 types of script
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

- Driver script
- Single use script
- Project specific script
- Multi project script
